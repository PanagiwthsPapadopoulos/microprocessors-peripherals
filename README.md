# Microprocessors & Peripherals - Project Repository 🚀

## 📌 Course Overview
This repository contains three projects developed for the **Microprocessors & Peripherals** course at AUTh. The course focuses on **ARM processor architectures** and **ARM-based microcontrollers**, exploring their role as modern embedded computing platforms.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing these projects, students gain:
- A solid understanding of **ARM architectures** and **microcontrollers** 🏗️
- Hands-on experience in **embedded software design** using assembly & C 💻
- The ability to select **optimal programming techniques** for embedded systems ⚙️
- Evaluation skills for **speed, cost, and power efficiency** of implementations ⚡💰
- Proficiency in using **commercial tools** for ARM-based development 🛠️
- The capability to build and program **custom ARM-based systems** 🎛️

## 📂 Repository Structure
### 🔹 `Lab-1/` - **ARM Assembly Hashing & Fibonacci**
- Implements a **hashing function** in ARM assembly.
- Computes **modulo 7 reduction** and applies the **Fibonacci function**.
- Two implementations:
  1. **Standard:** Uses memory to store values.
  2. **Direct-Result:** Returns values directly instead of storing in memory.

### 🔹 `Lab-2/` - **Real-Time Sensor Data Processing**
- Reads **sensor data** from UART.
- Applies **digital filtering** and signal processing.
- Outputs processed data via UART in real-time.

### 🔹 `Lab-3/` - **Embedded System with GPIO & Timers**
- Uses **GPIO & Timers** for event-driven execution.
- Implements **interrupt handling** for real-time processing.
- Controls external peripherals using **ARM assembly & C**.
